Awareness of these hazards and how to deal with them if encountered should not be taken lightly. Injuries or illnesses associated with field work can result in lost time for research or graduation, hospitalization, or even death. We have been lucky for many years to have only a few incidences, but without more awareness, the potential for more or even more serious injuries are increased. This document represents a survey of several hazards we can face in the field, how to avoid them, and how to deal with them if they do occur. A few general rules of thumb for all field activities are listed below: Table 3.1: Some of the Hazards that might be encountered in the field Surprised Land owners or neighbors Hunters Heavy brush and overhanging limbs Uneven Terrain Poisonous Snakes, Insects, &amp; Plants Heavy Lifting Slips, Trips, &amp; Falls Sun &amp; Heat Hazards Vehicle damage Soft or Mucky Soils Hand tools ATV safety Domestic &amp; Wild Animals Changing Weather Conditions Deep or Swift Water Electrocution Extreme Temperatures Moving Equipment Note: Modified From NCDENR http://www.enr.state.nc.us/safety/WSM%202003/Chapter%2026B/Wetlands%20Assessments.html 3.2 Review of safety practices. When necessary, be sure to contact with property owners before entering property. Working alone should be avoided. Try to work in pairs. Where necessary to work alone, ensure that all field personnel have dependable radio or telephone communication in case of medical or other emergencies. Be aware of hunting seasons. Many of the research sites we work on are prime hunting lands. Avoid working in early morning or late afternoon during these seasons. Wear blaze orange vests when in these areas. Park in areas that: provide safe entrance and exit to the work area; do not create potential conflicts with other vehicles and equipment operating in the work area; and provide maximum protection for workers getting in and out of the vehicles. The use of flashers and strobe lights is recommended to alert oncoming traffic. Do not block roads that may be used by large equipment on site. Avoid leaving state-owned vehicles in areas where they could be vandalized. Avoid driving through wet areas and areas with high vegetation that may hide sinkholes, ditches, rocks, abandoned equipment, etc. Use a spotter outside the vehicle to guide the driver though unfamiliar areas. The use of all terrain vehicles (ATVs) should be done responsibly. Avoid high speeds, quick turns, and severe grades. Helmets should be worn. Be aware of poisonous plants, insects, snakes, animals, and animal waste products and carcasses. It is a good practice to wear long sleeve shirts, gloves, and high-top boots when hazards cannot be avoided. If possible, avoid snake infested and brushy areas until cleared and checked. Wear boots or snake leggings. Use insect repellent. Wear long sleeves, light clothing, and tuck pant legs in socks when traversing through tick infested areas. Seek immediate help in case of snake or spider bites. Make note of attached ticks and watch the bite site for signs of infection. Keep an eye out for wasp, hornet, ground bee, or yellow jacket nests. Additional personal protective equipment may be necessary depending on the field work to be completed. This includes, but is not limited to appropriate footwear and eye protection (glasses, goggles, or shield). Based on conditions and equipment used, snake chaps, gloves and insect repellents may also be needed. Personal Floatation Devices (PFD) may be necessary when working in or around water deep or swiftly flowing water. Be aware of loose material, excavation drop-off, tripping hazards, and uneven ground. Carefully observe the terrain to avoid holes. Be aware of overhanging branches. Carefully observe ditches, swamps, and open water. Avoid soft bottoms or sinkholes. Use caution crossing ditches and streams. Try to avoid jumping over ditches or streams. Be aware of unique hazards associated with off road work, wooded areas, dam areas and streams. Note uneven terrain, swift water hazards, and underbrush. Avoid working under dead limbs and overhangs. Avoid working in wooded areas during high winds. Be careful in areas with briers, vines, and thick vegetation. Use care when using brush-cutting tools. Keep tools well maintained, sharpened and clean. Use insect repellant (i.e. DEET) or pre-treat clothing (i.e. Permethrin/Permanone) to protect against mosquitoes, biting flies, ticks, and chiggers. Many of these can cause allergic reactions or serves as vectors for more serious diseases (ex. West Nile virus, Lyme disease, Rock Mountain spotted fever) Take extra precautions to prevent heat and cold stress when working in extremely hot or cold temperatures. (i.e., frequent breaks and increased intake of hydrating fluids in hot weather). Know signs, symptoms, preventive measures, and treatment of heat exhaustion, dehydration, and heat stroke. Use sunblock to prevent sunburn. Protect eyes from UV exposure with sunglasses. Remain alert to changing weather. During adverse weather, avoid tall trees, antennas and high ground in case of lightning. Seek shelter in vehicles away from tall objects. Note demeanor of domestic dogs and contact owner if needed. In wilderness areas, make plenty of noise to alert animals. Avoid contact with wild animals showing signs of distemper or rabies. Insects, spiders, snakes and small mammals are frequently found in underneath items left in the field, or in field sampling equipment housings. Always use caution when picking up or opening anything in the field. When picking up things off the ground (like logs, rocks, PVC pipe, pieces of lumber) it is best to turn them over first with preferably with a shovel or safely positioned GLOVED hand. When opening sampler housings, carefully position the housing between you and the opening in case something decides to fly, run, or crawl out. Be sure to check if wasp or ant nests have been built underneath sampler housing platforms since you last visited. Proper lifting techniques shall be used. Get help or use mechanical equipment if necessary. Be aware of low hanging power lines and possible underground cables when digging. The use of generators to power tools should be done with extreme caution near wet areas. Review Safe Operating Practices for equipment used in the field and perform pre-operational checks before leaving for the field. It is your job to let your supervisor know if you have any allergic reactions to insects, plants, foods, etc., or conditions that would make it difficult to perform work in the field (like asthma) . Please make a note in your field bag of the address and phone number of the closest hospital or urgent care to your research site. Please review this document and we will meet regularly to discuss and update the contents. Let’s make our field research experience a safe one. 3.3 Dealing with Hot &amp; Cold Temperatures Heat and cold are two safety concerns that you will likely encounter while working in the field. With a few precautions, their affect can be reduced and field work can safely proceed. 3.3.1 Reactions and Symptoms 3.3.1.1 Heat: Heat Stress - can occur with various degrees of severity. Heat Cramps – After excessive sweating, the body has depleted its moisture and salt levels which can cause painful muscle cramps. Symptoms: Muscle pain or spasms in the legs, arms, or abdomen. Heat Syncope – Fainting or dizziness, usually after prolonged standing or sitting and rising to a different position Symptoms: Fainting, dizziness, or light-headedness Heat Exhaustion – After excessive sweating, the body has depleted needed moisture and salts. Symptoms: Heavy sweating; Extreme weakness or fatigue; Dizziness; confusion; Nausea; Clammy, moist skin; Pale or flushed Complexion; Muscle cramps; Elevated body temperature; Fast and shallow breathing Heat Stroke – The body is no longer able to control its temperature and is unable to cool down. Can cause death or permanent disability if emergency treatment is not given. Symptoms: Hot, Dry Skin (no longer sweating); Hallucinations; Chills; Throbbing Headache; Very High Body Temperature; Confusion; Dizziness; Slurred Speech Sunburn – occurs after excessive exposure to the sun. It take as little as 15 minutes for skin to be burnt but may take 2-4 hours for symptoms to begin to occur. Symptoms: Painful, reddened skin 3.3.2 Protection 3.3.2.1 Heat Wear Light-colored, loose fitting, breathable clothing Schedule heavy physical work during the cooler parts of the day Take frequent breaks in the shade, especially in extreme heat and humidity Drink water frequently, By the time you are thirsty you are already beginning to dehydrate! Avoid Drinks with Caffeine, Alcohol, and large amounts of sugar During extreme heat, consider rescheduling your field day for a cooler day 3.3.2.2 Sunburn Use sunscreen, especially on the neck, ears, and nose/face. The higher the SPF, the better protection Wear a hat that shades your face and possibly neck If especially sensitive to sunburn consider, long sleeves and a collared shirt (to protect the back of the neck). Avoid the sun if you have already been burned. 3.3.2.3 Cold Wear appropriate clothing, wear several layers of warm clothing, and bring a layer that also blocks wind. Be sure to wear a warm hat, gloves, and warm socks (They are often overlooked in importance). If out in wet conditions, make sure these items are waterproof or resistant. Try to stay dry while in the field, consider bringing changes of socks and gloves just in case you get wet. During extreme cold, consider rescheduling your trip or limit time out in the cold by taking frequent breaks to warm up. Be sure to eat and drink enough, this will give your body energy to regulate its temperature Don’t forget chapstick for the wind!!! 3.3.3 First Aid 3.3.3.1 Heat For most heat related stress, do the following: Stop your activity; get out of the sun and into the shade or an air-conditioned area Begin to sip water slowly You may want to pour some water on yourself to aid in cooling, or place cold items on pressure points (inside wrists and neck/chin) Consider taking the rest of the day off until you recover, going back to your activity could lead to more severe heat stress. For more severe heat related stress, such as a heat stroke, do the following: Get the victim into the shade and cool them down (if victim feels steady enough to move, otherwise, create shade), soak his/her clothes with water. If conscious, have the victim sip water. Monitor conditions, don’t leave the person. Call 911 for emergency treatment 3.3.3.2 Sunburn Sunburn creams (Aloe Vera and others) are available over the counter If sunburn is severe (blisters form, etc) then consider seeking medical treatment Cold 3.3.3.3 Hypothermia Move to a warm area (like in the truck with the heat on high). Remove any wet clothing. If available, sip a warm beverage. If the victim shows any of the Late Symptoms listed above or seems very confused and disoriented then call 911 for emergency treatment. 3.3.3.4 Frostbite Move to a warm area. Do not walk on frostbitten feet or use frostbitten hands (it can increase the damage). Immerse the affected area in lukewarm (not hot) water. Warm the affected area using body heat. Do not rub or massage the frostbitten area (can cause more damage). If frostbite is severe, seek medical treatment. 3.4 Electrical Safety Electrical safety practices are often overlooked, ill-prepared for, and ignored despite the relative ease of incorporating such protocols. Electrical safety procedures (ESPs) are necessary due to several possible dangers, to include, but not limited to : Electric shock Electrocution Fires Explosions The following list contains items that pose electrical safety hazards. You may typically use or come in contact with these items, so it is imperative to ensure that you recognize these items and know how to safely use, transport, store, repair, and/or dispose of this equipment. Batteries (3.5V, AAA, AAA, C, D, 6V, 12V, +) Battery Chargers, generators, and solar panels Electrical outlets, Extension cords, and electrical fittings Computers Refrigerators Vehicles Several ESPs exist to help keep you safe around the above equipment, as well as many other pieces of electrical equipment : Turn off equipment when not in use Turn off equipment during periods of increased atmospheric electrical activity Turn off equipment during periods of atmospheric precipitation Turn off equipment when attempting to move or repair Turn off equipment if in contact with foreign objects/liquids Ensure only waterproof equipment is used outdoors where contact with water may occur Properly store, shield, and protect all equipment, including waterproof equipment Do not attempt to repair equipment beyond your expertise Disconnect power sources before transporting or attempting to repair equipment As a Graduate Research Assistant (GRA), you typically have limited, yet still potentially serious, interactions with sources of electricity. Many of the items you may utilize each day can pose an electric safety risk, thus it is imperative that these sources, risks, and ESPs are identified, understood and practiced. On the next page, several of these sources, risks, and ESPs are shown; however, this list is not all-inclusive2,3, . SOURCE DESCRIPTION MOST PROBABLE ELECTRICAL RISKS ESP(s) Generators - Gasoline powered, internal-combustion engine - Electric shock Use outdoors only and ensure proper ventilation - Used to power tools, heaters, appliances, RVs, etc. Ensure main circuit break is OFF and locked prior to starting generator - Produce similar voltage to household electrical outlets Turn off and allow to cool before refueling - Most likely to cause electrical burns or serious injury Keep out of wet areas Power Lines - Overhead and buried power lines - Electrocution Identifity location of lines before using overhead or digging equipment - Extremely high-voltage - Fires Stay at least 10’ away from power lines and assumed they are energized - Most likely to cause death; can cause fires/explosions - Explosions Use non-conductive wood or fiberglass ladders when working near lines Extension Cords - Insulated wires to allow remote operation of equipment - Electric Shock Check for wear on insulation and replace cord as needed Check for loose wires or terminals and replace cord as needed Use only extension cords approved for the appropriate use Use only equipment that is approved by standard-setting organizations Do not modify or improperly use extension cords - Most likely to cause serious injury or electrical burns - Fires Use only 3-wire type extension cords Use only cords, connection devices, and fittings containing strain relief Remove cords by pulling on plugs, not the cord Remove cord from area &amp; store properly when not in use Keep out of water Batteries, Various pieces of equipment use batteries - Electric Shock Keep non-waterproof equipment out of water Chargers, (and related items) for power, such as: Replace broken or worn-out equipment/parts Solar panels power tools, automated samplers, pumps, etc. Disconnect power source before servicing or transporting equipment Finally, the last common source and electrical safety risk is lightning. Lightning is considered to be one of the major causes of death due to weather phenomena. It is a large discharge of electricity that can reach 5 miles long, raise the temperature of the air by 50,000 degrees Fahrenheit, and contain up to 100,000,000 volts. It occurs due to a negatively charged storm attracting positively charged particles on the ground surface. As the magnitude in charge difference increases, the positively charged particles travel up tall objects (poles, trees, houses, even people) which further attracts the negative particles in the clouds. When the charges get close enough, a channel forms to transfer the electrical energy, and this channel is called lightning. Thunder is induced by the rapid expansion of air and is heard after the strike due to light traveling faster than sound. Also, injuries and/or deaths are not always caused by direct strikes; as current travels through the ground or through water, those nearby can still be in harm’s way. The following list reveals a few facts about lightning . The Earth is struck by more than 100 lightning bolts every second. The odds of being struck by lightning in the U.S. during any year are 1:700,000. The odds of being struck during your lifetime are 1:3,000. Lightning has killed at least 3,696 people in the U.S. (from 1959-2003). If a strike doesn’t kill, it may cause cardiac arrest, severe burns, or permanent brain damage (from memory loss to personality change). Approximately 10% of strike victims die, 70% suffer serious long-term effects (about 400 people survive strikers each year in the U.S. Lightning is not confined to thunderstorms – it can occur during volcanic eruptions, intense forest fires, nuclear detonations, snowstorms, and in hurricanes. Rubber-soled shoes will not protect you from lightning Talking on the phone is the leading cause of lightning injuries, inside the home Standing under a tall tree is one of the most dangerous places to take shelter If your hair stands up, it may indicate that you are about to be struck If you can hear thunder, you can be struck by lightning (typically up to 10 miles away) Lightning can, and does, strike in the same place twice A vehicle may shield you from a direct strike, but do not touch metal surfaces or electronic equipment An umbrella, golf club, etc. will increase your chances of being struck In order to avoid lightning dangers, follow the below guidelines during electrical events4: Seek shelter if you hear thunder or see lightning. Do not stand under or near tall objects Stay away from windows Do not use phones, computers, electrical equipment, or cords Basements are typically the safest place in a house Do not lie on a concrete garage floor, as it may contain a wire mesh Do not use the shower/bath, sink, washer or dryer since they contain several electrical paths to the exterior of your home Avoid being the tallest object anywhere Do not hold onto a metal or other conductive "],
["useful-knots-in-the-field.html", "Chapter 4 Useful knots in the field 4.1 The bowline knot 4.2 The clove hitch", " Chapter 4 Useful knots in the field Inevitably, everybody in the field has had to make a knot in the field to tigh, to attach, to pull hard things, etc. Well with a knowledge of a minimum number of knots, you can make your life easy. 4.1 The bowline knot Eric Tabarly, a famous French sailer when interviewed in the 1960s about knots he knew and most used famously answered: the bowline; and others? - the bowline! Indeed the bowline knot is probably one of the very best and useful knot there is: it never slips and can easily be undone, even after having put on a heavy load. The bowline is an ancient and simple knot used to form a fixed ‘eye’ at the end of a rope. It has the virtues of being both easy to tie and untie; most notably, it is easy to untie after being subjected to a load. The bowline is sometimes referred to as King of the knots because of its importance. It is one of the four basic maritime knots (the other three are figure-eight knot, reef knot and clove hitch) (Wikipedia contributors 2018b). Figure 4.1: 1. The rabbit hole. 2. Out comes the rabbit, 3. runs around the tree, and 4. hops back into its hole. And in a video: Figure 4.2: tying a bowline knot from animatedknots.com 4.2 The clove hitch It is often considered one of the most important knots and is commonly referred to as a Double Hitch (Wikipedia contributors 2018a). Unlike the bowline which has a loop of given dimension, the clove hitch tightens around an object and prevents slipping on the given object.
