Indeed the bowline knot is probably one of the very best and useful knot there is: it never slips and can easily be undone, even after having put on a heavy load. The bowline is an ancient and simple knot used to form a fixed ‘eye’ at the end of a rope. It has the virtues of being both easy to tie and untie; most notably, it is easy to untie after being subjected to a load. The bowline is sometimes referred to as King of the knots because of its importance. It is one of the four basic maritime knots (the other three are figure-eight knot, reef knot and clove hitch) (Wikipedia contributors 2018b). Figure 4.1: 1. The rabbit hole. 2. Out comes the rabbit, 3. runs around the tree, and 4. hops back into its hole. And in a video: Figure 4.2: tying a bowline knot from animatedknots.com 4.2 The clove hitch It is often considered one of the most important knots and is commonly referred to as a Double Hitch (Wikipedia contributors 2018a). Unlike the bowline which has a loop of given dimension, the clove hitch tightens around an object and prevents slipping on the given object, provided that the object be not slippery. It has one problem though: it tends to bind. But for many applications, this is what we are interested in.

Under load, it is meant to cling very tightly onto the other line. It is used as a safety knot by arborists. When not under load, it can freely be moved up and down the other line. It is the quintensential knot for tent tensioner. It can also be used as a very effective way to grip around a shaft, woodstiff, etc. that you want to remove out of where it is installed (upward vertically most of the time). The hitch just clings very tightly to the shaft and this provides a great grip onto the shaft, which one could not obtain by hand alone.
