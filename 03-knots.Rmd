# Useful knots in the field

Inevitably, everybody in the field has had to make a knot in the field to tigh, to attach, to pull hard things, etc. Well with a knowledge of a minimum number of knots, you can make your life easy. 

## The bowline knot

[Eric Tabarly](http://www.sailing.org/halloffame/eric_tabarly.php), a famous French sailer when interviewed in the 1960s about knots he knew and most used famously answered: the bowline; and others? - the bowline! Indeed the bowline knot is probably one of the very best and useful knot there is: it never slips and can easily be undone. 

> The bowline is an ancient and simple knot used to form a fixed 'eye' at the end of a rope. It has the virtues of being both easy to tie and untie; most notably, it is easy to untie after being subjected to a load. The bowline is sometimes referred to as King of the knots because of its importance. It is one of the four basic maritime knots (the other three are figure-eight knot, reef knot and clove hitch) [@Wikipedia_contributors2018-fd].
